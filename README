~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ISSUES

- was not sure how to test for timer; may or may not work
- was confused on what we should be outputting to adder_log for index so i sent the process
  that was passed in as the ith process
- the depth is backwards (i.e. highest depth is actually displayed as 0)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOW TO RUN

1. Type 'make' in the terminal
2. Run as './master' followed by options and file name; if no options are specified, it is set to default
3. Type 'make clean' to remove executables, object files, and logs files
